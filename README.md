## 🛠 Technologies

*   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
*   **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN): Utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
*   **JavaScript**: Simple logic to toggle between the different screen designs.
*   **Iconify** (via CDN): Vector icons for social logins and input fields.
*   **Google Fonts**: Uses the 'Inter' font family for clean typography.

## 🚀 Getting Started

No installation needed! Since this project uses CDNs for libraries, you can run it directly from your file system.

1.  **Clone** or **Download** this repository.
2.  Open `Login screens.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
3.  Use the tabs at the top of the screen to switch between the **Clean**, **Futuristic**, and **Artistic** designs.

## 🎨 Customization

You can easily customize the styles by editing the Tailwind utility classes in `Login screens.html`. 
The custom animations (like `float`, `shimmer`, `gradient`) are defined in the `<style>` block at the bottom of the file.
